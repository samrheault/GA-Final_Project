# GA-Final_Project
Exploratory data analysis and predictive models using open source Instacart data

## Project Objective(s)

#### Description
Our final project asks you to apply your skills to a business problem of your choice. The capstone is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your new skills and tackle a pressing issue relevant to your team, division, or organization. Youâ€™ll generate a hypothesis, analyze internal data, and generate a working model, prototype, solution, or recommendation.

#### Deliverables
You will get structured guidance and designated time to work throughout the course. Final project deliverables include:

- **Project Proposal**: Describe your chosen problem and whether you have access to relevant data.
- **Project Brief**: Share a brief summary of your initial analysis and next steps in order to get assistance from your instructional team.
- **Technical Notebook**: Submit a cleanly formatted Jupyter notebook (or other files) documenting your code and process for technical/peer stakeholders.
- **Presentation**: Present a summary of your business problem, approach, and recommendation to an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.


## The Dataset
Instacart open-sourced 3 million orders from its databases. We recommend you read more via its engineering blog [here](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2).

**Possible Areas to Examine**

- How does time of day affect an order?
- What types of items are reordered most often?
- How many different cart sizes do there appear to be among buyers, and what meaningful differences exist in those baskets of goods?
- How does order affect when a user adds something to their cart?

> Note: This data set is quite large, and taking a random 10-percent sample (with justification) is acceptable.
